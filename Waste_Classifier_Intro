*The project was inspired from Alistair King's  Recyclable and Household Classification dataset :
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alistairking/recyclable-and-household-waste-classification

*The following deep learning model is able to classify the picture of any given object or material into recyclable and non-recyclable

*The image can be captured using the CV module of python and then loaded locally into the file space of the google colab notebook containing the dl model

*The model uses a confidence threshold which gives the following advantages :

1. Reduces False Positives  
- By setting a higher confidence threshold, the model only accepts predictions that it is highly confident about.  
- This is useful in applications like fraud detection or medical diagnosis, where false positives can have severe consequences.  

2. Improves Precision 
- A high confidence threshold increases **precision** (i.e., fewer incorrect positive predictions).  
- Ideal for scenarios where the cost of a false positive is high, like self-driving cars detecting pedestrians.  

3. Increases Model Interpretability
- Helps users trust the model by filtering out uncertain predictions.  
- Example: In **spam filtering**, emails classified with low confidence can be flagged for manual review instead of being deleted.  


4. Reduces Noise in Multi-Class Classification
- Helps eliminate incorrect or overlapping classifications by ensuring the model is sufficiently confident before making a decision.  
- Example: In image recognition, if a model is uncertain between "cat" and "dog," it can reject the prediction instead of making a wrong classification.  

5. Efficient Post-Processing
- In applications like **object detection**, setting a threshold removes low-confidence bounding boxes, improving the clarity of results.  

6. Optimizes Resource Usage 
- Filtering out low-confidence predictions prevents wasting computational resources on incorrect outputs.
